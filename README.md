# Maharashtra-Real-Time-Air-Quality-ETL-Project
A serverless data pipeline that extracts real-time air quality data, transforms it using Python, and loads it into AWS Glue for querying via Amazon Athena.

## ‚ú® Features
- Serverless architecture using AWS Lambda
- Real-time air quality data from Data.gov.in
- Daily automated ETL with AWS EventBridge
- Data transformation and cleaning using Python
- Queryable structured output using Athena


## üéØ Objective
To collect, transform, and analyze real-time air quality data of Indian state Maharashtra or it can be done for across Indian cities also using a scalable, fully managed AWS solution.


## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

![ETL Architecture](./aqi_project.png)

> The pipeline consists of two Lambda functions for extraction and transformation, with data moving through S3 and AWS Glue to Athena.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Cloud**: AWS
- **Data Source**:  https://www.data.gov.in/resource/real-time-air-quality-index-various-locations
- **Services**: Lambda, S3, Glue, Athena, EventBridge, S3 trigger(Load Lambda function)

## üîÅ ETL Pipeline

### üì• Extract
- AWS Lambda triggered by EventBridge on hourly basis(maharastra_air_quality_load function)
- Fetches data from Data.gov.in API
- Saves raw JSON to Amazon S3

### üîß Transform
- S3 event triggers another Lambda(maharastra_air_quality_extract function)
- Cleans and enriches data like:
-  1.adding new columns like range, aqi_value, air_quality, data and time column.
-  2.pivot_time_city: To analyze how AQI values vary hourly across different cities.
-  3.pivot_date_city: To analyze day-by-day AQI variations per city.
-  4.pivot_city_pollutant: To analyze which pollutants dominate in which cities based on AQI contribution.
- Outputs structured CSV/Parquet to transformed S3 location

### üì§ Load
- AWS Glue Crawler infers schema from transformed data
- Data is cataloged in Glue
- Amazon Athena is used for SQL queries
